# Udemy-website
My project is a simple and responsive learning platform inspired by Udemy. It lets users explore available courses through a clean and intuitive interface. The design focuses on user experience, structured navigation, and attractive visual layout. Built to enhance my web development skills and demonstrate front-end UI styling.
